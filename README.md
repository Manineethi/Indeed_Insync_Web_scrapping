web scraping is a technique to  extract information from website. 
For example, If we want to find the top influencers in tik tok, business can scrape the data and analyse to find one.
Here in this project we scrapped Indeed url to gain some job insights and to analyse the market trend. 

We filtered our scraping by 11 states and 24 job titles as input,focusing for the states, California, Florida,  and so on.
And job title we focused on IT jobs like Data Scientist, to machine learning engineers and so on.
